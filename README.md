# Regression
We are writing out sample codes to refresh our skills theoretically and practically in various regression techniques which may include-
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Ridge Regression

Further, during the way, we will also implement the Gradient Descent Algorithm (s) to learn the things at the very basic level.
